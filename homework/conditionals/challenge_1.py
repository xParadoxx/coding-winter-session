"""
write a program that asks the user for a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive). then report to the user the following:

if the number is even or odd
if the number is prime, composite, or neither (which number is neither...?)
ensure that the user enters a number between 1 and 5 (you can print an error message if they supply an invalid number).
OPTIONAL: include error handling in your code to avoid non-int input
