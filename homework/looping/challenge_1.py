"""
Write a simple "shopping cart" program that asks the user for a series of product prices.
Compute sales tax (7%) on each price and print out the new price to the user.
Next, ask the user if they want to enter another price - if they do, repeat the process.

If not, end the program.

Here's some sample output:

Enter an item price: 1.00
Tax on this item is 0.07 ; total price: 1.07
Enter another price? (yes or no): yes
Enter an item price: 2.00
Tax on this item is 0.14 ; total price: 2.14
Enter another price? (yes or no): yes
Enter an item price: 3.00
Tax on this item is 0.21 ; total price: 3.21
Enter another price? (yes or no): no
