"""
Write a program that takes in as input a list of positive numbers. Note, you pass in the numbers one by one, and one by
one, they should be added to your list (or processed in some way).

After that, find the min and the max of the numbers in your list.

NOTE:
    1: one design choice: you can have the user tell you BEFOREHAND how many numbers he / she will input for your list.
    2: do NOT use the sort or the reverse method
    3: do NOT use the min / max functions
