This is a sample program, where we explore different concepts in python.

Each instruction in python gets its own line.

In order to execute this file / application, you must "run it" --> using PyCharm

First and foremost, let's discuss the print()

print() is a built-in function (functionality here) that literally just prints whatever is in between the parens out to
the screen (the little output window in the bottom -- console)
"""

# print("hello world, my name is mo")
print('hello world, my name is mo')
# print("this is another print statement")


"""
this is a comment

comments don't get executed by the runtime system (aka "python")
"""

# this is a single line comment
# single line comments start with a hash and only cover one line

"""
this is a multiline comment

in python, you can either use single or double quotes, as long as they each have a buddy

in C-style languages (java, C, C++, etc.):
    '' --> char
    "" --> string
    
this is where the bulk of our "lessons" will be
"""

'''
this is also a multiline comment

print("WHATEVER IS HERE GETS PRINTED TO THE SCREEN IN THE CONSOLE")

"""
programming is all about style and convention

convention is something that the greater community (python or really any language community) determines as the standard

style is something you pick. you like it, and you're comfortable with it, just as long as it is easy to read and doesn't 
complicate anything, you should come up with your own style
